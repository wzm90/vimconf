This repository contains vim configuration files and several plugins for my daily programming use. So I can maintain a consistent editing environment at different places through this repo.

I use vundle (http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to manage my vim plugins.

To use this:
  1. git clone --recursive git://github.com/wzm90/vimconf ~/.vim/
  2. Open Vim, type ":BundleInstall" and vundle will download all required plugins automatically.
  3. Close Vim and make a soft link for ~/.vimrc:
     ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
  4. You can now enjoy using Vim!

Notice:
  Exuberant ctags is required for TagList. If exuberant ctags is not installed, TagList window is disabled in winManager.
