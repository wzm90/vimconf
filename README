This repository contains vim configuration files and several plugins for my daily programming use. 
So I can maintain a consistent editing environment at different places through this repo.
To use this:
  1. git clone --recursive git://github.com/wzm90/vimconf ~/.vim/
  2. Make a soft link for ~/.vimrc:
    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
  3. Notice: Exuberant ctags is required for TagList. If exuberant ctags is not installed, TagList window is disabled in winManager.
