This repository contains vim configuration files and several plugins for my daily programming use. 
So I can maintain a consistent editing environment at different places through this repo.
To use this:
  1. Move the whole folder to the directory: ~/.vim
  2. Make a soft link for ~/.vimrc:
    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
